# DATA 3320 (project 2: Homelessness)

## Description 
using the data science methodology to investigate homelessness in the U.S., predict homelessness rates based on local housing market factors.

## Data 
The data for this project are described in HUDâ€™s report [Market Predictors of Homelessness](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/Market-Predictors-of-Homelessness.pdf) to an external site. in the section titled DATA.

## Data Preparation
before an analysis can be made, the data given has many predictors we can use but many of them do not much impact in helping predict the rate of homelessness. Following the Colab notebook [DATA_3320_Homelessness_Data_Preparation_Long_Tran-Thien.ipynb](https://github.com/longhtt/Homelessness/blob/main/DATA_3320_Homelessness_Data_Preparation_Long_Tran-Thien.ipynb) we can see how the clean data [clean_homeless_data.csv](https://github.com/longhtt/Homelessness/blob/main/clean_homeless_data.csv) was created
